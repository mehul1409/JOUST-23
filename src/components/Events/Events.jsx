Typically called before the session of the Parliament or before the introduction of a bill, this committee aims to arrive at a consensus before the sessions begin. It is a supplementary body to the Parliament without any legislative provisions. The AIPPM Committee, unlike the other conventional MUN committee, is characterized by unrestricted political debate, cross talks, and high levels of negotiations focussing on emulating political realities by bringing to light various layers of polity and governance in India.</div>

                            Instead of the traditional public speaking-focused aspect of Model UN, the reporters of the International Press move from committee to committee, carefully examining delegates’ foreign policy, observing new alliances between nations, and reporting on the key ideas of various resolutions. Additionally, the reporters organize and attend press conferences, interview delegates, and write short articles, resulting in either high praise of innovative and favorable resolution papers, or bring upon heavy criticism of controversial solutions passed by a given committee. They do not represent any country’s interests, allowing them to act as unbiased journalists. Reporters are both active and passive participants in the conference ensuring the transparency and accountability of the United Nations.
