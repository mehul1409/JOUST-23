The Joust was meant to rekindle the spirit of Jaypee Youth Parliament, and expand its horizons to include other events apart from committee negotiations. The Joust 2016 went a step further, comprising of five major events. The Literary Festival reached its peak in 2017 in its third edition, with 7 events, 300 participants and a stellar Executive Board. The Joust 2018 & Joust 2019 being an event as grand as one could hope for, The Joust 2023 is determined to come back with an event that matched, if not exceeded, the previous one's glory and takes the legacy forward.</div>
